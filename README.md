# Unity-VR-Gaussian-URP
Scripts for using Gaussian Splats in Unity VR with the Universal Render Pipeline.


These scripts replace the scripts of the same names in Ninjamode's project:

This, along with the accompanying YouTube video, is the best method I've found to get this project working stereoscopically on my Meta Quest 3. Full disclosure: I am only a part time Unity hobbyist, and issues with the render pipelines are far beyond my skill level, so I had Anthropic's Claude help me with the code while I beat my head against a wall to figure out which Unity project settings to change to get this to work. Hope you enjoy the fruits of my headaches.
